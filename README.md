#SARS2 NYC

This project was presented by Scarlett at the 2020 APPAM meeting. We used the ACS, MEPS, and Medicaid data to estimate the number of people in NYC with conditions such as COPD, HIV, Cancer, etc which would put them at higher risk of severe complications with Covid. We focused on individuals aged 50+.

This repository contains the code that involves the MEPS. We used the Medicaid data to estimate the number of people with these conditions. Using the MEPS, we then calculated the ratio of privately insured people to Medicaid people with these conditions and repeated this for other insurances to scale the Medicaid data esimates (which theoretically should be better than the MEPS).
